Challenges of this project:

The accuracy of the model depends on the quality of the dataset.<br/>
The model may not be able to predict the price of a car accurately if the car's features are not included in the dataset.<br/>
The model may not be able to predict the price of a car accurately if the market conditions have changed since the dataset was collected.<br/>
